# python-exception-handling

## Description
This python script demonstrating error handling, list indexing, and basic arithmetic operations. It includes examples of handling specific exceptions such as ModuleNotFoundError, NameError, and ZeroDivisionError, with a general exception handler and a finally block.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the `pandas` library installed.

## Usage
Run the script using the following command:
```sh
exception_handling.py
```

## Code Explanation
This script performs the following tasks:

- Imports the pandas library.
- Initializes two variables `a`and `b`.
- Prints the values of `a` and `b`.
- Creates a list and prints the fourth element.
- Performs a division operation.
- Catches and handles different types of exceptions.
- Prints a success message if no errors occur.
- Executes a finally block which runs regardless of whether an error occurred.

## Error Handling
The script includes error handling for:

- **ModuleNotFoundError:** When a module is not found.
- **NameError:** When a variable is not defined.
- **ZeroDivisionError:** When division by zero is attempted.
- **General exceptions** for any other errors.
